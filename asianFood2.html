        <p>Chop Suey – a saucy chicken stir fry loaded with tender pieces of chicken, vegetables and smothered in Chinese brown sauce just like you get at the best Chinese restaurants! Use any vegetables you want in this quick and easy stir fry.<br>

          This recipe also shares two little known Chinese restaurant secrets so you can make a stir fry that genuinely is as good as your favourite take out!</p>
        <h3> <i> Chop Suey – Chicken Stir Fry</i> </h3>
        <p>Chop Suey is just a slightly westernised version of a classic, basic Chinese stir fry. Because of this, there really aren’t hard and fast rules about what goes in it, but the general characteristic is that the sauce is a fairly light brown
          colour, there is <b>plenty of it </b> (and you know I love my sauce!!) and it’s pretty thick so it clings to your rice or noodles.</p>
        <h3>How to make a Chop Suey that’s REALLY restaurant quality</h3>
        <p>if you’ve ever wondered why your stir fries aren’t quite as tasty as what you get from (good) Chinese restaurants, here are the two things you’ve probably been missing:</p>
        <h4>SECRET 1 – CHINESE COOKING WINE</h4>
        <p><b>Chinese cooking wine (or Shaoxing Wine)</b> is the secret ingredient in almost every Chinese recipe that’s used by the gallon in Chinese restaurants around the world! It adds depth and complexity of flavour into even the most simple
          sauces with just a small amount. Read more about it here, including why it’s so important, the difference it makes in recipes and the best substitutes.<br>

          <b>Best substitutes for Chinese Cooking Wine – </b>Mirin or dry sherry.<br>

          <b>Best</b> non alcoholic substitute for Chop Suey is to use chicken broth (liquid chicken stock) in place of water in the sauce.<br>

          <b>Chinese Cooking Wine (Shaoxing rice wine, Shao-hsing or Shaohsing) - </b>an essential to make truly tasty stir fries like Chinese restaurants. recipetineats.com
        </p>

        <h4>SECRET 2 – TENDERISED CHICKEN</h4>
        <p>Have you noticed that the chicken in Chinese restaurants is incredibly soft and almost “velvety”? It’s because restaurants “velvet” the chicken (that’s the term that is used). <br>

          There are a few ways to do this, but I like using a simple method where the chicken is coated in a small amount of baking soda (bi-carb), left for 20 minutes to tenderise, then rinsed before cooking in the stir fry. It’s the easiest and
          least effort for home cooking – and 100% effect.<br>

          <b></b>Velveting is optional </b>if using chicken thighs because it’s a juicy cut. But if you are using chicken breast or tenderloins and you choose to tenderise it, you are going to be amazed how juicy and tender the chicken is.<br>

        <h3>What goes in Chop Suey</h3>
        <p>I’ve make Chop Suey with ingredients that are commonly used by Chinese restaurants – Asian greens (Choi Sum), bean sprouts, carrots and mushrooms. But feel free to use whatever vegetables you want!</p>
        <h3>How to make Chop Suey</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Chop Suey is a 5 minute stir fry that starts off by sautéing garlic and onion before adding vegetables in the order in which they cook. Vegetables that take longer to cook go in first, and more delicate vegetables (like leafy greens) go
            in last.</li>
          <li>Then the sauce is added, simmered for just a minute or two so it thickens, then served immediately over rice to soak up all that tasty sauce!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What to serve with Chop Suey</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>With all that tasty sauce, Chop Suey demands to be served with rice! Though if you’re looking for a low carb option, cauliflower rice is a terrific alternative.</li>
          <li>If you’re making this as part of a larger banquet or you want to make a menu to serve 4+ people, try adding some of these other dishes to your menu:

          </ol>
          <h3> Recipe Notes:</h3>
          <p>1. Tenderised Chicken: Read more about Velveting Chicken the Chinese way for ultra tender chicken like you get in Chinese restaurant stir fries. <br>
            Skip the step if using chicken thigh - it's not needed, it's juicy enough.<br>
            2. CHARLIE is my All Purpose Stir Fry Sauce. If you haven't met him yet and you love stir fries, you are going to be best friends very soon. Find the recipe for him here, along with how to use him. To use Charlie for this recipe, replace
            the Sauce with 4 tablespoons of Charlie + 3/4 tsp cornflour / cornstarch + 3/4 cup water.<br>
            3. LIGHT SOY SAUCE: This is what keeps the sauce colour clear-ish. You can use ordinary all purpose soy sauce and it will pretty much look the same. If you use dark soy sauce, reduce to 1 tbsp - will still be tasty but the sauce will be
            super dark brown and a stronger soy flavour.<br>
            4. Oyster sauce - substitute with Vegetarian Oyster Sauce (available at some large grocery stores) for vegetarian / shellfish free option.<br>
            5. CHINESE COOKING WINE: An essential in Chinese cooking, used by every Chinese restaurant. Read more here.<br>
            Substitutions: dry sherry or Mirin, followed by Japanese cooking Sake.
            Non alcoholic: Use chicken broth instead of water in the Sauce.<br>
            6. No need to marinate the chicken for this recipe because it's sliced thinly and there's plenty of sauce!<br>
            7. Nutrition per serving, assuming 2 servings. It's 2 very generous servings, with enough vegetables for a meal - you won't need a side for this. Excludes rice / noodles. Use low sodium soy sauce to reduce sodium.</p>
