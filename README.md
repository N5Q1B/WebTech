‘Food Capital’ is a website for an online food recipe where anyone with a valid account can add their articles and people can use our website to know different kinds of cooking methods. This website shows different kinds of cooking styles and food items.
 
 
 



1.  	Project Description
Our website “Food Capital” focuses as a platform for users to share their food recipes. Thus, it will redound to the benefit of other users as they can learn new recipes. Our website shows the most trending and the most searched food recipes offered all around the world. We established a few objectives of our website:
●	Gives an insight to users who do not have cooking backgrounds so they can acquire the skill to cook for themselves or their family.
●	To allow many users to share their recipes on our website so that they can learn from one another through their recipes.
●	To discover the hidden talents among the users so that they can be more confident in showcasing their cooking skills.
 
Our main focus is to make our website a user-friendly platform for users all around the world to learn and showcase new recipes. To ensure our success, our website gives chances for users to prove themselves on their skills in making amazing foods on our review blog. This function essentially allows other users to comment on their cooking. They can provide feedback for the users to improve on their food recipes and learn from their mistakes. It is important for users to receive feedback on their recipes as they can attract food reviewers so that they will receive positive reviews on their recipes.
Lastly, this website can be part of our everyday life as we cannot spend a solitary day without eating.  Mahatma Gandhi said - “There are people in the world so hungry, that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread.” And if the food is good the day is the best one. And if one wants a good mood, one needs good food. So, no more delay, do registration and stay with us.

Each of the members has created web pages for the projects. Everyone was active in our group and deeply hardworking. Below in the box we are giving more specifically who had done which part for the project:
 
 
Name	Contributions
Hareez Ishraf bin Hazrudden
(1911923)	●	Pages: About Us, Homepage, Footer, Privacy and Terms & Conditions
●	 Web elements: Logo
●	Making links of the contact such as Youtube, LinkedIn,etc in the footer.

Maymuna Gulfam Tanni
(1739566)	•	Pages: Everyday Food, Easy Recipes, Kid Friendly Recipes, International Cuisine, Western Food, African Food, Asian Recipes. Linked with recipes page.
•	Web elements: Logo, Images of foods.
•	Added one or more than one images in the pages of each recipe with the appropriate styling.
•	I have used HTML for paragraph writing and creating headings, list. Then use CSS for design purposes like photo, structure etc.
•	I have used JavaScript to link the pages. For example, users are now on the recipes page, with all types of food articles there. There is some sub-navigation bar under the recipes page such as Categories, Everyday Food, Easy Recipes, Kid Friendly Recipes, International Cuisine, Western Food, African Food, Asian Recipes etc. I used JavaScript to make the navigation of each bar easier to use. Suppose the users want to see the everyday food page, it will direct the users to that page. No need to go out from the page, or no need to open a new window/page, no need to log in multiple times to visit one page. Users can also move the previous page to the next page. This makes the website more spontaneous for the user. So, I tried to make our website user friendly.
